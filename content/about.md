### What is this place?
This domain serves as a space to perpetuate my existence online while at the same time rejecting social media. 
Despite being a shitposting machine, I sincerely hope this website forces the content I contribute online to be of more value to myself and others.
Additionally, the modern web is way too fucking bloated so the "small web", gemini/gopher protocol design and philsophy apply here. 
Being hosted on the Tor network also obviously adds more incentive to optimize load times / embrace minimalism. 
### Who am I?
I wake up, go to work, come home and pretend to be a gay dog on the Internet. 
My xmpp is "tail@osrs.dog" if you want to say hi.
