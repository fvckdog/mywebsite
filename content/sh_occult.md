[Interview with the director of Silent Hill 1](https://www.polygon.com/2013/10/30/5048140/silent-hill-creator-discusses-how-he-joined-the-game-biz-and-why)

"I never liked the really bloody shock-fest sort of horror film, so I was kind of at a loss when we started out. **What I am a fan of is occult stuff and UFO stories and so on"**

## What is "The Occult"?

The Occult is a neutral body of knowledge and understanding constaining powerful insights into the human psyche and the world we inhabit. Much of occult knowledge is deepy spiritual and psychological. It is not religious, yet all religions use it.

## Cybil Benett
The name Cybil in Greek Mythology is given to a prophetess or fortune-teller. The last name of Bennett comes from Latin where the word 'benediction' or 'blessing' is derived. 
Cybil tells Harry she is from the next town over, Brahams. The name Brahams is dreived from the Hewbrew name Abraham.

"It's dangours out there." | "Have you got a gun?"

The Prophet gives her blessing before he embarks on The Hero's Journey.

## The Hero's Journey

The Hero's Journey is a well recognized theme and is a deeply human affair. It's as old as the Collective Unconscious of humankind and is a pattern which minifests itself in our daily lives.

### Find the 3 keys

In order for Harry to truly begin his kourney, he needs to locate 'The Keys for Eclipse'.
The Lion Key is found in a cop car (courage). Nearby is a large Chasm, which is what The Lion needed to jump over in The Wizard of Oz. The Scarecrow Key is found by walking over a fallen tree inside of an empty mailbox on the edge of town. In The Wizard of Oz, The Scarecrow suggets chopping down a tree in order to cross a valley. The Woodman Key (AKA The Tin Woodman) is found next to the severed head of a dog. In the Wizard of Oz story, The Tin Woodman decapitates a pack of wolves dispatched by the Wicked Witch.

### The Wizard of Oz hole gets deeper

L.Frank Baum, the author of the original Wizard of Oz story was a member of the Theosophical Society, which is an organization focused on occult research and the comparative study of religions. With this in mind, Baum clearly had a deep understanding of theosophic teachings when writing his story. The entire story is an allegorical tale of the soul's journey towards englitenment. The same concept of The Yellow Brick Road is referred to as the "Golden Path" and is an integral concept in many theosophical beliefs. Heart, Mind & Courage are sought after on this journey.

## The Two Medallions - Male and Female

Male and female are deepy woven into the entire world's spiritual consciousness. Male and female are especially important to alchemical theories, represented well symbolically on the tarot and truly survived the test of time. The King and Queen maintain royalty even on modern playing cards today. 

Harry's next task is to collect two medallions. **The Gold** Medallion is located in the **science lab**. Of course, the counterpart is a **Silver** Medallion waiting to be discovered in Midwitch's **music room**. 
The Gold Medallion is appropriately seated on the **left** while Silver Medallion is fitted to the **right** side of the tower. 

If you couldn't already tell, these two key items are perfectly represented symbolically as male and female. The sun and moon, logic and creativity, left and right, and so on.
